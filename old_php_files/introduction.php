    <li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I once built a PC version of Super Metroid because I was bored. It uses combination of manipulating the SNES's memory, spoofing the inputs on first player's controller, and a slightly customized ROM file to add some additional controls and other improvements to the game. If you want to try it out, you can download the latest version <a href="https://github.com/LTSchmiddy/super-metroid-pc-edition-snex9x-public/releases">here</a>.</li>
