<h2 id="coursecontract">Course Contract:</h2>
<p>I, Alexander Paul Schmid, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2019, <em>WEB115-85 Web Fundamentals</em> class with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
<p>Signed: Alexander Paul Schmid, 8/28/2019</p>
