# Course Contract:

I, Alexander Paul Schmid, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2019, _WEB115-85 Web Fundamentals_ class with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.

I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.

I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

Signed: Alexander Paul Schmid, 8/28/2019
